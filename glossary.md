Python: A high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Interpreter: A program that reads and executes code, allowing for the execution of Python scripts.

Variable: A storage location in memory, referenced by a name, that contains data like numbers, strings, or more complex types.

Function: A reusable piece of code that performs a specific task. It can take arguments and return a result.

Module: A file containing Python code, which can define functions, classes, and variables for use in other programs.

List: An ordered collection of items that can contain any type of data and are mutable (changeable).

Tuple: An ordered collection of items, similar to a list, but immutable (unchangeable).

Dictionary: An unordered collection of data in a key-value pair form.

String: A sequence of characters, enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

Integer: A whole number data type.

Float: A decimal number data type.

Boolean: A data type that can have two values: True or False.

Loop: A control structure that repeats a block of code as long as a condition is met. Examples include for and while loops.

Conditional Statement: Code that executes based on whether a condition is true or false, such as if, elif, and else.

Class: A blueprint for creating objects, which can have properties and methods.

Object: An instance of a class.

Inheritance: A mechanism in which a new class can inherit properties and methods from an existing class.

Exception: An error detected during the execution of a program.

Try-Except: A block of code used to handle exceptions gracefully.

Lambda: A small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.

Decorator: A design pattern in Python that allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure.

Generator: A type of iterable, similar to a function but returns an iterator that can be iterated over.

Yield: A keyword used in generators to return a value from the generator function.

List Comprehension: A concise way to create lists based on existing lists.

Slice: A mechanism to select a range of items from sequence types like lists, tuples, or strings.

Import: A keyword used to include a module or package in the current script.

Package: A way of organizing related modules into a single directory hierarchy.

PEP 8: Python Enhancement Proposal 8; a style guide for writing Python code.

Indentation: The whitespace used at the beginning of a line to define the level of code blocks. Crucial for Python's readability.

Duck Typing: A concept where the type of a variable is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its class.
