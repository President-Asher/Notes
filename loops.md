for loops are used to iterate over a sequence and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
Example 1:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


while loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is True.
Example 2:
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
